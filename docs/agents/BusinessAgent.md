# Business Agent

The Business Agent (BusinessContextAgent) is an intelligent component that gathers business context and domain knowledge for SQL generation. It uses concept matching, business rules, and domain expertise to provide rich business context that enhances the accuracy and relevance of generated SQL queries.

## üéØ What It Does

The Business Agent provides sophisticated business context gathering:

- **Concept Matching**: Matches user queries to business concepts and domain knowledge
- **Business Rules**: Applies business rules and constraints to SQL generation
- **Domain Expertise**: Leverages domain-specific knowledge for better query understanding
- **Join Validation**: Validates that required table joins can be satisfied
- **Example Retrieval**: Finds relevant examples and patterns for similar queries
- **Entity Coverage**: Analyzes how well business concepts cover identified entities

```

1. **Entity Analysis**: Analyzes identified database entities for business relevance
2. **Concept Loading**: Loads business concepts and domain knowledge for entities
3. **Concept Matching**: Matches user query to relevant business concepts
4. **Business Rules**: Applies business rules and constraints
5. **Join Validation**: Validates that required table relationships can be satisfied
6. **Context Assembly**: Combines all business context into comprehensive response

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Gather business context for customer analytics
python main.py --business-context "customer analytics" --entities "customers,orders"

# Business context with custom concepts directory
python main.py --business-context "user behavior" --concepts-dir "custom/concepts"

# Business context for specific business domain
python main.py --business-context "sales performance" --domain "retail"
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from src.agents.business import BusinessContextAgent
from src.agents.factory import agent_factory

# Get business agent from factory
business_agent = agent_factory.get_business_agent()

# Gather business context
applicable_entities = ["customers", "orders", "products"]
business_context = business_agent.gather_business_context(
    user_query="customer retention analysis",
    applicable_entities=applicable_entities
)

# Check business context results
if business_context["success"]:
    print(f"Matched concepts: {business_context['matched_concepts']}")
    print(f"Business instructions: {business_context['business_instructions']}")
    print(f"Entity coverage: {business_context['entity_coverage']}")
else:
    print(f"Business context failed: {business_context['error']}")
```

## üß† Processing Algorithm

The Business Agent implements sophisticated concept matching and business rule application:

### Stage 1: Concept Loading
```python
def gather_business_context(self, user_query: str, applicable_entities: List[str]):
    # Load concepts for identified entities
    concepts = self.concept_loader.get_concepts_for_entities(applicable_entities)
    
    # Match concepts to user query
    matched_concepts = self.concept_matcher.match_concepts_to_query(user_query, concepts)
    
    # Extract business instructions and examples
    business_instructions = self._extract_business_instructions(matched_concepts)
    relevant_examples = self._get_relevant_examples(matched_concepts, user_query)
    
    # Validate joins
    join_validation = self._validate_required_joins(applicable_entities, matched_concepts)
    
    return self._format_business_context(matched_concepts, business_instructions, 
                                       relevant_examples, join_validation)
```

### Stage 2: Concept Matching
```python
def match_concepts_to_query(self, user_query: str, concepts: List[BusinessConcept]):
    # Use semantic similarity to match concepts
    matches = []
    for concept in concepts:
        similarity = self._calculate_concept_similarity(user_query, concept)
        if similarity > 0.5:  # Threshold for relevance
            matches.append((concept, similarity))
    
    # Sort by similarity score
    return sorted(matches, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

### Stage 3: Join Validation
```python
def _validate_required_joins(self, entities: List[str], matched_concepts: List[Tuple]):
    validation_results = {}
    
    for concept, similarity in matched_concepts:
        required_entities = self._extract_entities_from_joins(concept.required_joins)
        available_entities = set(entities)
        missing_entities = required_entities - available_entities
        
        validation_results[concept.name] = {
            "valid": len(missing_entities) == 0,
            "missing_entities": list(missing_entities),
            "satisfied_joins": [join for join in concept.required_joins 
                              if self._can_satisfy_join(join, available_entities)],
            "unsatisfied_joins": [join for join in concept.required_joins 
                                 if not self._can_satisfy_join(join, available_entities)]
        }
    
    return validation_results
```

business_context = business_agent.gather_business_context(
    user_query="customer behavior analysis",
    applicable_entities=["customers", "orders", "products"]
)

# Check matched concepts

```python
# Sales performance query
business_context = business_agent.gather_business_context(
    user_query="sales performance by region",
    applicable_entities=["sales", "regions", "products", "customers"]
)

# Apply business instructions
for instruction in business_context["business_instructions"]:

```python
# Check join validation
join_validation = business_context["join_validation"]

for concept_name, validation in join_validation.items():
    if validation["valid"]:
        print(f"‚úÖ {concept_name}: All joins satisfied")
    else:
        print(f"‚ùå {concept_name}: Missing entities {validation['missing_entities']}")
        print(f"   Unsatisfied joins: {validation['unsatisfied_joins']}")
```

### 4. Entity Coverage Analysis

Analyze how well business concepts cover entities:

```python
# Check entity coverage
coverage = business_context["entity_coverage"]
print(f"Total entities: {coverage['total_entities']}")
print(f"Entities with concepts: {coverage['entities_with_concepts']}")
print(f"Coverage percentage: {coverage['entities_with_concepts']/coverage['total_entities']*100:.1f}%")
```

4. **Concept Components**: Concept loader and matcher components
5. **Dependencies**: All required packages from requirements.txt

## üîß Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

2. **Matching Errors**: API failures, invalid similarity calculations
3. **Join Validation Errors**: Invalid join syntax, missing entities
4. **Entity Coverage Issues**: No concepts found for entities

### Error Response Handling

```python
# Handle business context errors
try:
    business_context = business_agent.gather_business_context(
        user_query="customer analysis",
        applicable_entities=["customers", "orders"]
    )
    
    if not business_context["success"]:
        error = business_context.get("error", "Unknown error")
        
        if "Failed to load concepts" in error:
            print("Business concepts not found")
            # Use default business context
        elif "Concept matching failed" in error:
            print("Unable to match business concepts")
            # Continue with minimal context
        elif "Join validation failed" in error:
            print("Join requirements cannot be satisfied")
            # Provide alternative suggestions
            
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Business context gathering failed: {e}")
    # Implement fallback mechanisms
```

### Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Concept Fallback**: Use default concepts when loading fails
2. **Matching Fallback**: Use keyword matching when semantic matching fails
3. **Join Fallback**: Provide simplified joins when complex joins fail
4. **Entity Fallback**: Use entity name matching when concept matching fails
